# Sadly this is the kind of function that's incredibly easy to type statically
# in something like TypeScript, but apparently impossible to type statically in
# Python. Basically the TypeScript typing looks like this:
#   type OmitNulls<T> = {[K in keyof T]?: OmitNulls<NonNullable<T[K]>>};
#   function withoutNulls<T>(data: T): OmitNulls<T>;
# But the Python type system (currently?) lacks mapped and index types, so you
# can't recurse over an arbitrary type's structure as OmitNulls<T> does, as
# well as conditional types so you can't easily define a "filtering" utility
# type like NonNullable<T>. Python's type system also doesn't infer a
# dictionary literal as having a structural type by default in the way
# TypeScript does, of course, so that part wouldn't work anyway.
